Alternate repository location here: https://github.gatech.edu/jbruck6/supervised_learning.

The code to run this project is available at https://github.com/jacklbruck/supervised_learning.

The steps to run the code are pretty straightforward. First create an environment however you would like to. Then pull and pip install this repository, preferably with the -e flag.

To get the cross validation results for every model, run python -m supervised_learning.main. The results will be written to a folder within the install location as pickled .npy files.

It takes a very long time to run every model because, admittedly, I went a little overboard on the hyperparameters.

If I missed any requirements or left any pieces of analysis from my push to github, please let me know. I don't want to lose points on clerical stuff and will be happy to get things working literally any time of the day.

Looking forward to feedback. This was a lot more work than I expected, even given the many, *many* warnings ahead of time!
